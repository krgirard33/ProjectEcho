# Project Echo - WIP

Interstitial Journaling app. Mostly, I need a better way to track what I am working on at work, and this concept looked interesting. 

Plans for the future: 

* Limit what shows in the past to just the last 14 dates. 
* Create a calendar that will let me click on a date and see all the entries for that date. 
* Have it show me how long between entries
* Maybe figure out a way to have it make me enter a goal list for the day
* Re order date/time, so that the most recent is at the top.
