# Project Echo - WIP

Interstitial Journaling app. Mostly, I need a better way to track what I am working on at work, and this concept looked interesting. 

Plans for the future: 

* Limit what shows in the past to just the last 14 dates. 
* Create a calendar that will let me click on a date and see all the entries for that date.
